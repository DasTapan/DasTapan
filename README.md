### About Me

My name is Tapan Das, and I am a front-end developer looking to switch careers to pursue my passion for coding. I have 6 years of experience in a different field, but I have always been interested in technology and web development. I have been learning and doing projects for last 14 months and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a new career path.
